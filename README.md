Abstract:  
The feasibility of using aftermarket backover avoidance technology to reduce backover collisions is only dependent on whether or not a person owns a vehicle which does not have a functioning backup camera. If car owner does not have a backup camera, then installing one is important and there are models that are affordable for most any budget.  

Drivers of larger vehicles, such as pickup trucks, SUVs, or minivans, take a substantial risk every time they back their vehicle due to the large size of the rear blindzone of these vehicles. Drivers of cars with smaller blindzones are still taking risks when backing, even if they do not have an excessively large blindzone. Sometimes, though, drivers of cars think they are taking less of a risk when they are actually not; many new styles of cars which place the back window slightly higher than the front window for a sleek design have rear blindzones which can be even worse than the blindzones of many pickup trucks.  

Considering the fact that backing is usually for only a very short distance at a slow speed, the large number of injuries and deaths every year which involve backing vehicles shows that drivers need to be able to see where they are going. The government has acknowledged this need by requiring new vehicles to be manufactured with rearview cameras soon, but that will not help drivers of cars which do not already have cameras.  

In the same way that drivers make sure their cars are safe by purchasing and installing new tires when the old ones get worn down, drivers also need to make their cars safe by purchasing and installing cameras so they no longer back blindly.
